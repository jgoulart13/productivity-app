My project is a task management tool that lets a user build a backlog of tasks, move those tasks into a view, and then time and complete their tasks.  Users can only select three tasks for their main view and can only time one task at a time (users are encouraged to stay on the page, the timer stops when you leave as the goal is to focus and complete the task when you start it). Users can also view all of their completed tasks and delete them permantly if they wish!  

Files that I created follow the standards we have been using all semester.  You will find a static folder with JS and CSS as well as a templates folder with HTML files.  You'll find my Python files follow the standards from the semester as well, in that my application has the appropriate models created and urls for their associated views.

Enjoy!
